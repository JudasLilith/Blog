## My first Website
This is my first time creating a website, so I wanted to 
This is a place for me to write my blog posts, store occasional notes that I think people would benefit from (APUSH, AP Art History, FRC Game Manuals)
and a gallery page for my projects. I want them all to have a brief discussion & be directly linked to my github README files for the ones I have them. 

index.html - Main Page with name
GalleryDirectory - List of my projects
ArticleDirectory - List of Blog Posts
NotesDirectory - List of notes(To google docs, etc.)

Not_found - The name implies what it's for.....



Mostly made from flexbox, tried utmost valuing view screen versatility.


I had to hassle with the GIT lfs, but nonetheless it worked

Great, so for people who want to follow making this website, know that you need git LFS to search the large PDF file notes I have.
So please, be sure to check everything works for a file bigger than 100MB.

Be sure to check if they are able to even commit, I cant even fix this right now

Oh wait writing just worked
okay
I think I just might have to fucking write everything by hand again

## My first Website
This is my first time creating a website, so I wanted to 
This is a place for me to write my blog posts, store occasional notes that I think people would benefit from (APUSH, AP Art History, FRC Game Manuals)
and a gallery page for my projects. I want them all to have a brief discussion & be directly linked to my github README files for the ones I have them. 

index.html - Main Page with name
GalleryDirectory - List of my projects
ArticleDirectory - List of Blog Posts
NotesDirectory - List of notes(To google docs, etc.)

Not_found - The name implies what it's for.....


Mostly made from flexbox, tried valuing view screen versatility.
